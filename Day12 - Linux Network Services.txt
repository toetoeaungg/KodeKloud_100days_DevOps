Analysis the issue

##check the port usage with netstat
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 6200

## issue is using the same port from 2 services, so stop one service and restart the apache service
sudo systemctl stop sendmail
sudo systemctl disable sendmail

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

### issue is still can't call from other host with curl and telnet
## check the iptables rules
sudo iptables -L -n --line-numbers

#### add the iptables rule for allow port 6200
sudo iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 6400 -j ACCEPT
